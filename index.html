				<p>He came from somewhere back in her long ago
				The sentimental fool don't see trying hard to recreate
				What had yet to be created once in her life
				She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
				Never coming near what he wanted to say
				Only to realize
				It never really was
				She had a place in his life
				He never made her think twice
				As he rises to her apology
				Anybody else would surely know
				He's watching her go
				But what a fool believes he sees
				No wise man has the power to reason away
				What seems to be
				Is always better than nothing
				And nothing at all keeps sending him
				Somewhere back in her long ago
				Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
				Someday, somewhere, she will return
				She had a place in his life
				He never made her think twice
				As he rises to her apology
				Anybody else would surely know
				He's watching her go
				But what a fool believes he sees
				No wise man has the power to reason away
				What seems to be (if love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?)
				Is always better than nothing (fool's got the power)
				There's nothing at all (oh, now)
				But what a fool believes he sees (i believe she's never gone away)
				No wise man has the power 
				To reason away (to reason away)
				What seems to be (oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama)
				Is always better than nothing (better than nothing)
				And nothing at all</p>
				<p>You ain't crazy
				I ain't gonna lie anymore
				What you're feelin'
				There's a reason for
				I wanna do right
				Oh, I gotta do right
				Do I love you
				Oh, you know I've tried
				But what you're after
				You can't find in my eyes
				I wanna do right
				Hmm, hmm, hmm, horns

				Darlin'
				Tell the truth
				Don't turn away
				This is our last chance
				To touch each others heart
				Does anything last forever
				I don't know
				Maybe we're near the end
				(So come and tell me)
				So darlin'
				Oh, how can we go on together
				Now that we've grown apart
				Well the only way to start
				Is heart to heart

				One by one
				We're collecting lies
				When you can't give love
				You give alibis
				Now I'm gonna do right
				This time I gotta do right
				I don't wanna leave
				I don't wanna say good-bye
				Sooner or later
				Honey, there comes a time
				Tomorrow, when you gotta do right
				Come on home

				Darlin'
				Tell the truth
				Don't turn away
				From this one last chance
				To touch each others heart
				Does anything last forever
				I don't know
				Maybe we're near the end
				(So come and tell me)
				So Darlin'
				Oh, how can we go on together
				Now that we've grown apart
				Well the only way to start
				Is heart to heart
				(Why are you so torn apart)
				I need a little more lovin' in my heart
				(People say that love will grow)
				So how was I to know
				Love that's come through years and years
				Can't find a way back home
				Anymore
				Darlin'
				Tell the truth
				Don't turn away
				This is our last chance
				To touch each others heart
				Does anything last forever
				I don't know
				But maybe we're near the end
				So darlin' tell me
				Oh, how can we go on together
				Now that we've grown apart
				Well the only way to start
				Is heart to heart
				Does anything last forever
				I don't know
				But maybe we're near the end
				So darlin' tell me
				Oh, how can we go on together
				Now that we've grown apart
				Well the only way to start
				Is heart to heart</p>
